Big TODO Items Before 0.1 Release
---------------------------------

o 	BSD groups can be done but do we care ?
IP	Termios and speed hooks to tty drivers
DONE	hangup ioctl (vhangup) plus hangups for group leader exits
DONE	rename should delete old files it renames over
o	SYS5 signal functionality and other signals (SIGCLD, STOP etc)
IP	SYS5 signal holding
o	ptrace
o	Core dumps
o	time_t bits hidden in inode
o	n_openw() - as n_open but errors on R/O mount or media, getinodew ??
	and update setftime ?
NA	RTC setting
DONE	Lock clock to RTC seconds
o	Can we make the mount point buffers writable to disk too so we can
	drop the quiet ones when busy ?
IP	Simplify exec logic and split into multiple functions
o	Add "shared lib" (or more accurately copied lib) support for libc
	to keep binary size small
o	Can we make inodes partially pageable given our on disk guarantees ?
	Disk inode in cinode would then become a pointer. Might allow more open
	objects and less memory usage. Might be nicer alternative to the BSD
	inode shrinking hack (although that would fix the time_t question!)
o	Finish the cpm emulator port
IP	Make object alignments 16bit friendly
DONE	Add fields to binaries giving load page (so can load Z80 0x8000
	binaries safely etc)

Big Speed Up Points
-------------------

o	Rewrite the compressor in assembler
o	Support 'raw' I/O on files
o	Make execve use this to avoid all the copies
o	Vfork
DONE	Make mount pin a buffer rather than keeping mount blocks around
	unused.

Maybe
-----
o	Different magic for "big" fs - 32bit block numbers only on raw
	devices. Split blkno_t into blkno_t blknodev_t or similar
DONE	Carrier handling for tty devices
o	Revoke 8)
DONE	Uptime/loadaverage/swapfree etc data
o	Virtual device hooks for networking
o	Pty/tty devices
o	Finish select/poll
